An unique and memorable album which was more of a listening experience than simply a collection of songs. 

It's one of the rarer situations where my enjoyment in fact descreased as it progressed, perhaps due to the novelty wearing off or just the high bar set at the beginning. 

The overall vibe created from the first few tracks is deeply unserious though certainly enjoyable, with silly vocal effects accompanied with childishly simple melodies and rhythms. Rather than a nautical theme which some describe it as having, I consider it more an underwater theme, accompanying tropical fish in coral reefs. 

It does deteriorate into more typical rock later in the course, with more guitar and a more generic sound too.

Overall my opinion is positive, though I can't be certain I would find myself listening to much of it again, simply as a consequence of lack appropriate context if nothing else.
