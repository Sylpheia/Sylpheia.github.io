**A whimsical album with a very memorable theme and character**

This is more of an entire listening experience than simply a collection of contemporary songs, but it was one of the rarer situations where my enjoyment in fact decreased as it progressed, perhaps due to the novelty wearing off or just the high bar set at the beginning. 

The mood created from the first few tracks is deeply unserious though certainly enjoyable, with silly vocal effects accompanied with childishly simple melodies and rhythms. Rather than a nautical theme which some describe it as having, I consider it more an underwater theme, accompanying tropical fish in coral reefs. 

It does deteriorate into more typical rock later in the course, with more guitar and a more generic sound too.

Overall my opinion is positive, though I can't be certain I would find myself listening to much of it again, simply as a consequence of lack appropriate context if nothing else.
