**Both cosy and moody like an enveloping autumn embrace, Beach house immutably carve out their position as _the_ genre defining artist of Dream Pop**

Close to perfection in terms of quality, consistency and musical completeness, only a couple of weaker tracks leave open the possibility of this album's being surpassed, and it remains the year's best by some margin. Much like their [self titled debut]({% post_url 2023-07-05-Beach-House %}){: .inlinelink }, a characteristic feature is the clarity with which they set and pursue their intended sound for the album, with any track immediately recognisable in seconds as being part of _Devotion_ even if only the others had been heard prior to this. Of course, in places this is achieved structurally, for example by the short intros that feature throughout their discography. But overwhelmingly, it is due to a more specific atmosphere of dark warmth which they manage to construct in what feels like as many ways as is possible, every time leaving one wondering how can a song fit the theme so well yet still be so individual. 


It seems that my predictions having listened to 'Beach House' came true, with this album very accurately and consistently matching the vibe of Gila and Heart of Chambers. To elaborate, every song gave off a safe, warm feeling of nostalgia a la Loft Music, with rich instrumentation and flowy singing. One of the best albums i've heard recently; speaking both holistically and with regard to individual songs.
