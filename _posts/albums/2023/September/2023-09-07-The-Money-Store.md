A unique sound for sure, with most songs being less unbearable than they seem at first glance (a shimmering compliment, no doubt). 

Lyrics and flow were pretty decent when actually intelligible, though at points they did descend into unwelcome shouting. Some of my issue probably lies within the rapper's voice, since a less deep and more standard sound might in fact be rather pleasant. 

Instrumentals were industrial sounding but generally positive, perhaps being a little unimaginative on rare occasion which wasn't much of an issue given how busy everything else was. 

I can foresee in some contexts me listening to some of the tracks, and I also imagine they'll grow on me as I become more familiar with them .
