Fairly good, in the way all rap albums that I've heard of are bound to be, though this is certainly a cut above the typical drill mixtape, even if not completely to my taste.

Instrumentals were average in general with a few standouts here and there, but even they were more notable as a break from the norm than necessarily memorable after the fact. 

Headie was solid as usual, not quite hitting the levels in my favourites of his, though still maintaining a high level throughout. Lyrically K-Trap was on par, though I noticed a certain upward inflection he has whenever he drops a punchline which does become a little peculiar if not just annoying. It'd be fine to reserve this tone for the most disgusting bars, maybe a maximum of twice in a song, but after hearing it many, many times in just one verse it does seem quite odd. 

It seems K-Trap very much has an established style and I've no doubt someone who enjoys warm or his other music would enjoy this, but for me while its certainly about average, anything he drops is a low deviation 7 and just can never appeal that much to me (or hasn't done so yet). Of course Headie has an established style which he displays here too, though I'm more partial to it in the first place and obviously he has all his variety in his other projects which makes for extra appeal. 

I feel like I could like any of the songs as a solid 7 if I listened to them a few more times, though liking some would preclude me from liking others since they're too simiilar in vibe and thus I simply wouldn't have the time to listen to the same kind of music over and over.
